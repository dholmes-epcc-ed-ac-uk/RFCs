# RFC0012

## Title
Add APIs and internal support for RM-network library interactions

## Abstract
Add a network support framework and appropriate APIs so that the RM can:

    * precondition an application (e.g., adding a security token to the
      app's environment) prior to launch

    * setup the local network driver to support an application (e.g., for
      "instant on" address resolution) prior to spawning the local procs

    * pass directives in the environment of client procs prior to forking

    * cleanup after each child terminates

    * cleanup after all local children for a given application have
      terminated
