## Description
Applications and tools often interact with each other in ways that require verification of the identity of the user making the request, and access to that user's relevant authorizations. This is particularly important when tools connect directly to a system-level PMIx server that may be operating at a privileged level. A variety of system management software packages provide this service, but the lack of standardized interfaces makes portability problematic.

This RFC defines two new PMIx client-side APIs and two corresponding server interfaces to the host system management stack (SMS) for this purpose. These are most likely to be used by user-space applications/tools, but are not restricted to that realm.

#### Obtaining a credential
The API for obtaining a credential is defined as a non-blocking operation since the host SMS may have to contact a remote credential service. The definition takes into account the potential that the returned credential could be sent via some mechanism to another application that resides in an environment using a different security mechanism. Thus, provision is made for the system to return additional information (e.g., the identity of the issuing agent) outside of the credential itself and visible to the application.
```
/* Define a callback function to return a requested security credential.
 * Returned values include:
 *
 * status - PMIX_SUCCESS if a credential could be assigned as requested, or
 *          else an appropriate error code indicating the problem
 *
 * credential - pointer to an allocated pmix_byte_object_t containing the
 *              credential (as a opaque blob) and its size. Ownership of
 *              the credential is transferred to the receiving function - thus,
 *              responsibility for releasing the memory lies outside the
 *              PMIx library.
 *
 * info - an array of pmix_info_t structures provided by the system to pass
 *        any additional information about the credential - e.g., the identity
 *        of the issuing agent. The info array is owned by the PMIx library
 *        and is not to be released or altered by the receiving party. Note that
 *        this array is not related to the pmix_info_t structures possibly
 *        provided in the call to PMIx_Get_credential.
 *
 *        Information provided by the issuing agent can subsequently be used
 *        by the application for a variety of purposes. Examples include:
 *            - checking identified authorizations to determine what
 *              requests/operations are feasible as a means to steering
 *              workflows
 *            - compare the credential type to that of the local SMS for
 *              compatibility
 *
 * ninfo - number of elements in the info array
 *        
 * cbdata - the caller's provided void* object
 *
 * NOTE: the credential is opaque and therefore understandable only by
 *       a service compatible with the issuer.

Upon receiving a request for credential from a client, or calling the PMIx\_Get\_Credential

#### Validating a credential
The API for validating a credential is again defined as a non-blocking operation since the host SMS may have to contact a remote credential service. Provision is made for the system to return additional information regarding possible authorization limitations beyond simple authentication.
```
/* Define a validation callback function to indicate if a provided
 * credential is valid, and any corresponding information regarding
 * authorizations and other security matters
 * Returned values include:
 *
 * status - PMIX_SUCCESS if the provided credential is valid. An appropriate
 *          error code indicating the issue if the credential is rejected.
 *
 * info - an array of pmix_info_t structures provided by the system to pass
 *        any additional information about the authentication - e.g., the
 *        effective userid and group id of the certificate holder, and any
 *        related authorizations. The info array is owned by the PMIx library
 *        and is not to be released or altered by the receiving party. Note that
 *        this array is not related to the pmix_info_t structures possibly
 *        provided in the call to PMIx_Validate_credential.
 *
 *        The precise contents of the array will depend on the host SMS and
 *        its associated security system. At the minimum, it is expected (but
 *        not required) that the array will contain entries for the PMIX_USERID
 *        and PMIX_GROUPID of the client described in the credential.
 *
 * ninfo - number of elements in the info array
 *
 * cbdata - the caller's provided void* object

#### Associated attributes
One new attribute is included in this RFC:

* PMIX\_CRED\_TYPE:  when passed in PMIx\_Get_credential, a prioritized, comma-delimited list of desired
                     credential types for use in environments where
                     multiple authentication mechanisms may be
                     available. When returned in a callback function, a string identifier of the credential type

Several existing attributes can be utilized by the APIs in this RFC, with the meaning of the value somewhat dependent on the context of its use:

* PMIX\_USERID: the effective userid of the client in the credential, or of the client making the request

* PMIX\_GROUPID: the effective group ID of the client in the credential, or of the client making the request

* PMIX\_TIMEOUT: how long (in seconds) to wait for a response before timing out the operation


## Protoype Implementation
Prototype implementation is available in the PMIx master repo in [Pull Request 584](https://github.com/pmix/master/pull/584)

Note that the prototype implementation makes a "best effort" attempt to obtain and/or validate a security credential by first trying to obtain it from a system management service. If the service is not available, then the implementation will attempt to fulfill the request using the internal security components used by PMIx to validate client/tool connections to the server. As of this writing, that includes (depending on configuration logic) munge, a native uid/gid-based protocol, and a "none" component that is only active upon explicit request and is targeted for debug purposes.
